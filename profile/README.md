The name 'Kardenwort' evokes cardingâ€”the process of combing and straightening tangled fibers. In the same way, our toolkit processes raw, complex texts, meticulously organizing them into simple, clear, and context-rich vocabulary lists for language learners.

This philosophy is deeply inspired by Rich Hickey's influential talk, "Simple Made Easy." Kardenwort embodies the principle that achieving simplicity is hard work. The tool undertakes the difficult task of parsing linguistic complexity to produce a result that is truly simple: an untangled, organized list. This foundational simplicity, in turn, makes the process of creating cards and learning vocabulary easy for the end-user.

These lists are designed for a flexible workflow: they can be seamlessly imported into Anki to create rich flashcards, viewed directly within GoldenDict-ng for instant analysis, or opened in any spreadsheet application for custom use.
