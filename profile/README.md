The name 'Kardenwort' evokes cardingâ€”the process of combing and straightening tangled fibers. In the same way, our toolkit processes raw, complex texts, meticulously organizing them into simple, clear, and context-rich vocabulary lists for language learners.

These lists are designed for a flexible workflow: they can be seamlessly imported into Anki to create rich flashcards, viewed directly within GoldenDict-ng for instant analysis, or opened in any spreadsheet application for custom use.
